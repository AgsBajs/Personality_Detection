# Personality_Detection
One of my first Kaggle machine learning projects using Personality DataSet by Rakesh Kapilavayi

(Ongoing Project)

Performed data analysis and preprocessing on data, including taking care of null values, using one-hot encoding, and checking for linearity.
Training different models based on the context and using out-of-sample testing to check metrics and performance.
